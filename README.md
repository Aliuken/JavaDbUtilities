# JavaDbUtilities
Java project to get metadata from a database using JDBC.

The file JavaDbUtilities.docx explains in Spanish how to use this project.

I have written this project as the following answer in StackOverflow:

"I have created a project called JavaDbUtilities on GitHub. The project uses JDBC's DatabaseMetaData and it can print:
- All the primary keys or the primary key of a given table.
- All the foreign keys or the foreign keys of a given table. It also retrieves the cardinality of every relationship, which is useful to create the entity-relationship model of a given database.
- All the indices or the indices of a given table.
- All the unique indices or the unique indices of a given table.
- The records a given query or some given queries would return if an eager strategy is used on every foreign key. Useful to understand how ORMs like JPA/Hibernate work.
- The records that reference the resulting records from a given query or some given queries. Useful to know the impact of updating/deleting those resulting records."
